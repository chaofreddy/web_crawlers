Then I read the privacy policy!!!  For some reason, I overlooked the reviews related to this prior to purchase.  No thanks!  There is specific language within the policy to allow permissions to view your video, track web usage and passwords, even related to social media accounts. YI advised they were changing this back in December of 2017.  As of March 2018, nothing has changed within the privacy policy."

Privacy policy means no privacy...,1.0,"Over the course of several months, I ended up purchasing 4 of these devices and was generally satisfied with the image quality and ability to monitor.I then got update to privacy policy sometime in the fall. I read through it and found that by using the app, you are giving the company cart blanc to use your data in any way they want. I didn't accept the agreement. Left the camera plugged in, but didn't use the app that controls them. Yesterday, even though I had not agreed to the policy - I found that the Yi App had used 552MB of mobile data since late August. I hadn't downloaded any images in months. I forced stopped the application and have unplugged all my cameras.Seems over the top in permissions. They can obtain and share with 3rd party. What information - see some below? They note they can collect tons including your Wifi name and password. You can delete your account, but they have language saying that they can retain your information - forever...

Delivery of the item was on time and I got it set up on my android phone in less than a half hour.  We bought a 32GB micro SD card for it and positioned the camera to view outside the office window towards our front porch and the picture is very clear at all times of the day!  I am able to receive the alerts and view them from my phone and/or laptop. I am also able to view more than the 6 second clip if I want to watch the full footage of the movement.  It is easy to save the 6 second clip to the SD card; however it doesn't save the full footage.  But I found out that if I leave that clip in that day's activities then I can still view the footage.  I have set both the sensitivity and alert frequency settings to low and it still picks up passing vehicles but I am okay with that since I am able to delete the unneeded clips easily.  I am amazed and pleased that I can be hundreds of miles away and still be able to monitor my front porch.  And it's considerably cheaper than the Ring or Nest products. I am very pleased with this product!!!

After the return date passed, then the dreaded update came. Just skimming it, the policy seemed like a joke - no one could possibly be alright with all of your information being tracked and maintained indefinitely by multiple parties. I was forced to accept it simply to remove the camera from my account to able to give it away. Huge waste of time and money. I also wonder if the updates are set to wait until you can no longer return it."

Whenever they update their software they make you agree to their terms all over again! If you say 'no' then the camera will no longer work until you agree again! Their PC software times out on purpose. You think you are looking at a live picture from several feet away but they paused it without your permission and you are looking at something from hours ago. You have to be next to the screen to see it was paused. So much for security or a baby monitor. Useless.
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: YI Home Security Camera, 1080p 2.4G WiFi IP Indoor Surveillance Camera with Night Vision, Motion Detection, Phone App, Pet Cat Dog Cam Works with Alexa and Google Assistance","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2017","WAS GREAT, BUT HAVING ISSUES",4.0,"Updated 9/2018:I have tried several other known name cameras and the quality of this is very good compared those out there and with a good app. I just ordered another camera and actually read the privacy policy which I recommend you do, unless you don’t care about that stuff. Here’s my take in the camera itself.SETUPVery easy and quick. Only connects to 2.4G wifi.CAMERA / AUDIOVideo resolution quality is very good. Probably one of the best if not the best i’ve tested (Blink and Canary). If you’re curious about doorbell cams, I currently have a Ring doorbell 2 installed and this video quality is noticeably better and clearer pointing out in the same area. Night vision works well and is clear which can be manually turned off if desired. Streaming is fluid and haven't experienced any buffering or freezing yet. Clear picture and good colors. Motion dection WORKS through dual pane glass window! It will record motion as it picks it up. For example, I have the detection set only on the floor section of the porch so it only detects motions as soon as someone walks onto my porch (not walk by). If someone delivers a package and puts it on my porch which will then activate mobile notifications, the camera playback will record BEFORE the person fully walks up to my porch (the detection zone). The motion notifications to my cell is fairly quick. The microphone picks up sound very well through dual a pane window and the speaker can be heard clearly from outside for example if you put this at your front door and want to communicate.APPNicely designed and user friendly with lots of features. Here are just some of those features: set a 4 digit passcode or Touch ID to view camera feed, ability to turn camera and mic on/off, flip the image 180 degrees, pan view for wider angles in portrait mode (uses motion of your phone similar to the 360 videos or swipe), record while viewing live!, take and save snap shots while viewing live!, two way talk. Customize motion detection area size and placement. I've experienced live view connects in 3 seconds or less.STORAGEIt has a micro SD memory card slot! Not available with Canary and Blink. With YI you get free 6 second motion clips with cloud storage and if you want to view full clips you will need to add a micro SD card. Clips are saved for at least 5 days (could be longer, I haven’t really paid attention). YI also offers different storage plans so check those out if you plan on using that. I personally just use an SD card.BUILD QUALITYFirst packaging is quality (not that you care but is a nice touch). Build quality is excellent. I know it's a knock off of the Nest dropcam design but I don't care, it's $30! now (I paid $60 at the time) and it's excellent for the price. The camera itself is rotatable and removable from its stand which offers more custom mounting ideas with its design. The camera has to be plugged into power though. It comes with a decent length power cord but I think it should be longer. Wall mount is not included. Bottom of the stand has a rubber pad for sturdier stance.FINAL THOUGHTSI am impressed with this camera and what YI is offering their customers. They are definetly competing hard with the more expensive well known players like Nest, Blink, Canary, Samsung etc. If you’re ok with the privacy policy then this a good camera.UPDATE 2/2019:A couple things we’ve noticed is 1) the quickness to view the camera and 2) the apps recording alerts. What I mean by the first “issue” is when someone rings/knocks at the door, it takes a bit too long to open the app, load and view the person at the door. We have a pin/fingerprint lock set up on ours so that could be a factor. As for #2, what ever update Yi did to the app is frustrating. EVERYTIME we get a notification alert and go to the app to view it, it stays on loading and doesn’t show the recording or the alert. Very annoying and makes it sort of pointless. I know it’s not the app on my phone because my wife has the same problem on her phone. Hopefully they fix this issue real quick."

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: YI Home Security Camera, 1080p 2.4G WiFi IP Indoor Surveillance Camera with Night Vision, Motion Detection, Phone App, Pet Cat Dog Cam Works with Alexa and Google Assistance","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2017",Good system//1.5 year update,3.0,"Initial review and 1.5 year update.After one full week of usage, I'm ready to review the YI 1080P camera system.  Take that description with a grain of salt, because you get more than just a simple camera at a price that's almost stupidly low.  Over the next few paragraphs I'll go over the included hardware, features, setup and value and compare each of those aspects to other systems on the market.  Start your engines.So let's talk about the included hardware.  Each camera comes in a small box similar to a new cell phone.  They are so small that you will believe that they've forgotten something.  Nope, inside that tiny box is everything for a single camera system.  Open it up and you'll get the camera itself which is attached to its own base and, again, like a cell phone, a micro USB cord and outlet plug.  This means that if anything ever happens to your power cord, you can get a spare very quickly.  You'll also get some literature on setup and all that, which is pretty standard.  There is no base unit like Arlo has.  It's just a camera, similar to the Piper/Nest/most other systems.  The quality of the hardware is also very decent.  We all know the quality difference between Lego and Duplo, an iPad and a $60 tablet, a Yugo and a Honda.  These cameras are decent quality.  Maybe not at Nest standard, but good all the same.  They are not Duplo or Yugo but won't break the bank like Nest will.  That about sums it up for the hardware or included materials.  As I stated earlier, the box the camera comes in is super small, so if you order two cameras like I did, you'll be underwhelmed at the size of the box they come in.  Don't worry, good things come in small packages too.Moving on to features.  These 1080P YI cameras come with a boatload of features.  You can of course view them from your phone in and outside of your wifi network, so if you are at work and want to check in on your home, you can do that.  They have two way audio so you can talk with someone or mess with your cats while you are away (not that I've ever done this...).  Is it nighttime?  No problem, these have very decent night vision capability, so they can see in pitch black darkness.  Did something move over there?  These sense motion and record it.  Is something in the room always moving, like a fan but don't want that to set off the motion detection?  You can select a specific area of the room to detect motion in, and not other areas, so if you have animals like cats or dogs that roam around during the day, set the selection area higher so it won't detect them.  You can also set the motion sensitivity and alert frequency.  Maybe your cat is chasing a reflection on a wall from an open window and you don't want to constantly get an update every few seconds.  You can set the frequency lower and get fewer notifications.  You can also take videos or pictures of what your camera sees at will.  Of course all of this motion and recording can be set up to be stored on the YI servers or be saved to a micro SD card (not included, but you can get a 32 gb Samsung from Amazon for $12) for further review.  Have a set schedule?  Maybe you don't want it to record motion at night, but you are gone for ten hours during the day.  Set it up to record while you are gone.  You can of course turn it off at will from your phone.  There's also a crying baby setting.  I don't have a baby, nor am I going to borrow one to test the feature, but it does exist.  I'm guessing that it will listen specifically for that type of sound and send notifications specifically for it.  You can also add a bunch of cameras to a single system and jump between those cameras at will.  YI also makes a camera that can move and pivot 360 degrees.  I have no idea if that camera would integrate into this system, but I bet it would.  Most other good systems on the market have something along these features, so its par for the course here.  The lack of a giant siren that the Arlo system has can be seen as a downside, but none of the other major systems have these either, so take that how you want.So what about setting these things up?  How hard is it?  What's involved?  Well, this can be accomplished in just a few really simple steps.  The first thing you want to make sure of; that your phone you are using to set these up is on the same network as the cameras will be.  I run two separate wifi networks, a 2.5 and a 5ghz.  These cameras will currently only work on 2.5 ghz, so I had to jump over to the other network, no big deal.  So first, download the YI Home app and start it up.  Let the system guide you from here.  It will show you everything you need to know, but it's pretty basic.  Next you'll hit a small plus button to add a camera.  Plug in your YI camera and wait.  It will take about 30 seconds to turn itself on and it will begin talking.  Click on the app that you've heard the camera speak and your phone will display a barcode.  Simply show this barcode to the camera and it will log into the network.  That simple.  Then you simply set up the preferences I spoke about in the features area above.  It's so simple that a child could do it.Value.  Here it is.  If you've read this far, you know what's coming.  This system represents a value that cannot be ignored.  I bought it figuring that if I didn't like it, I'd force Amazon to take it back.  At $60 a camera, I figured I'd either get a great deal or return it to get something else.  Luckily, I got a fantastic deal.  For two cameras and two micro SD cards I'm well under the cost of a single Nest/Piper camera or the dual camera Arlo system.  The features and hardware quality are a serious contender against nearly any other system on the market.  Look, I know how it appears; cheap Chinese made cameras with an app system that can't be good, with features that probably don't really work.  All of that is wrong except for the ""cheap"" part, and that doesn't apply to the camera build quality.  This system WILL impress you.  It is however a more basic system in terms of its compatability with other things you may have in your home already.  I doubt that it will integrate with Alexa or any other system.  It's its own thing, and that's not bad.  The value is clearly there though and is easily seen once you directly compare this system to just about any other system on the market.  There is no reason to take my word for it, so go and view a couple of youtube videos and watch for yourself.  You can read any of my other reviews, and I think you'll find a common theme; value.  I always look for the value in something, especially in lower priced options.  Sure, the Nest cameras are nice.  Yes, the Piper system is good.  But at $60 a camera, are those systems worth $x more?  No, not to me they aren't.  I bought two cameras and the only thing I regret is not buying another one.  Maybe I'll remedy that right now....1.5 year update!!!So what's life been like with this camera system over the past year and a half?  Well, the road is bumpy and there are some faults, but overall, for the price you pay, it's a decent system.  Let's start with the good.The software seems to receive updates every few months, so that shows that the developers continue to work on the system.  The overall quality of the equipment is still good, no complaints here.  I did try out their premium service by paying for a subscription, and it worked well, but I didn't continue it as I just didn't think it added any value.The bad stuff.  Well, interacting with the system while away from home is mixed.  Occasionally I just can't access the cameras, and it isn't like I don't have good signal.  The system is laggy and it can take quite a while to get a live image to show up on the phone.  Sometimes you simply can't get one no matter how hard you try.  I usually just wait a few minutes and try again.There was a period of time a while back where no notifications would show up about movement detected.  I'd randomly open the app and see a pile of movement notifications that the system never let me know about....that angered me a great deal.  So I unplugged the cameras and logged out of the system to try to reboot the whole setup and it didn't work.  It took a whole update from the company to finally get notifications back.And the last problem I have with this system, is that sometimes it will tell me that there was movement on one of the cameras and when I go to look at the video, it gives me an error that simply says the video isn't playable.  This doesn't happen often, maybe around 5% of the time or so, but still, that shouldn't happen, ever.I deducted two stars from the review because of these failures.  I'm still using the system and I do think it's worth the money you pay for it, but it's far from perfect.  It's a great way to get into home security for low cost, but if you want something with more stability, look to higher priced options."

I gave this a 1 star rating due to the privacy policy they make you agree to before you use their service/app. I am not comfortable with the invasiveness of the company so I am returning it. They are allowed to track about everything you do.

In actuality it worked for only 4 days. Tonight when I went to power it up, the yellow light came on briefly, it made two clicks then the App showed an unknown error. The 'power on' button wouldn't respond at all.Edited & updated 6/27/18: After the camera had received updates it began to work what would be considered 'normal' again.

 *** 10/8/2020 ***They changed it back to normal and you can now view clips from the camera without subscribing to a plan. Thank you Yi Camera.*** 9/23/2020 **** Changed from 5 stars to 1 star: Very disappointed, it looks like you now need a subscription plan to review clips that the camera records based on activity (this was the best feature of the camera). Without a plan you can only view live footage from the cameras. i have 3 cameras and this is disappointing...----I’ve had several Yi cameras for years now and I can highly recommend this model (I have a yi dome camera but I actually like this mode better, it’s much smaller and seems to offer a wide enough angle without the bulk and moving parts) Yi camera is great, no need for any monthly subscription and the camera just works well. I love the ability to see any motion clips in the past which is really convenient. I use them to Monitor the kids when I’m at work and it works really well. Also when away on vacation, nice to have peace of mind and just check in to make sure there hasn’t been any activity. The microphone works okay, the two way calling isn’t great but I wouldn’t call that a huge downside. I tried the wyze camera but I think the yi camera is of higher build quality. I have one yi dome camera which is able to pan side to side but I think the angle of view of the basic yi camera is enough. The night vision works well. Pairing the camera is fairly straightforward. I would say highly recommend and buy a few for your house."

The recommended firmware update process did not adequately provide all information, such as renaming the update file to xxxxx.BIN. As it is, there is no way to tell if the update is actually working.I would also recommend considering the required permissions before installing the required Yi Home App. How much do you trust this company to give them carte blanche on your phone in addition to a video camera in your home?This app has access to:* Device & app history (Allows the app to view one or more of: information about activity on the device, which apps are running, browsing history and bookmarks)* Identity (Uses one or more of: accounts on the device, profile data)* Photos/Media/Files (Uses one or more of: files on the device such as images, videos, or audio, the device's external storage)* Camera (Uses the device's camera(s))* Microphone (Uses the device's microphone(s))* Wi-Fi connection information (Allows the app to view information about Wi-Fi networking, such as whether Wi-Fi is enabled and names of connected Wi-Fi devices)* Device ID & call information (Allows the app to determine the phone number and device IDs, whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a call )Other (Access download manager: download files without notification; full license to interact across users)Some of these are acceptable given the app's functionality, but why would it need access to know my browsing history and bookmarks?

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: YI Home Security Camera, 1080p 2.4G WiFi IP Indoor Surveillance Camera with Night Vision, Motion Detection, Phone App, Pet Cat Dog Cam Works with Alexa and Google Assistance","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2019",Great product for the price.,5.0,"Yi is a sub division of Xiaomi  that specializes in various types of cameras. They usually make pretty high quality stuff that pack lots of features at an affordable price point, this product is no exception. It comes well packaged and includes a 6ft micro usb cable and charging brick. The camera itself is very stylish and has a clean design.  I was very surprised when I first powered up the camera and heard the clarity of the speaker in the camera.The YI Home App is very intuitive and guides you step by step. This is a smart camera so it will need to connect to wifi to complete the set up and it will let you know this too. There is also space for an SD card (i believe 32gb is the max) and this is where the camera will store its recorded footage too. There is also the option to connect to the Yi cloud service for a monthly fee and this will give you the benefit of viewing and downloading footage wherever you are. I personally did not try this method.Once you setup the camera in your desired place the actual image quality isnt bad. It gives you too quality options which are SD & HD, the latter takes more recording space but is clearer. I really love the intercom feature where you can speak through the app and your voice can be heard from the camera. This is really neat. The built in mic picks up sound easily and this can be heard through your smartphone, there is also the option to disable it.The app itself is very clean and has a lot of parameters for adjustment which is great to see in a camera of this price point. If you are home and your phone and camera are on the same wifi network, you can get a live stream of the footage in addition to that you can also scrub backwards through the app to see if you missed anything.All in all I will highly recommend it.Please note, some reviewers have said that the cameras transmit data to some server located in china. I haven't checked this to verify but even if it does it will be transmitting footage of an empty gallery and backyard. Oh well."
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: YI Home Security Camera, 1080p 2.4G WiFi IP Indoor Surveillance Camera with Night Vision, Motion Detection, Phone App, Pet Cat Dog Cam Works with Alexa and Google Assistance","Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2018","Mediocre Product, Lacks Features, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!",1.0,"I purchased 3 of these back in November 2017, and have been using them for almost 4 months.  Originally, I had these set up on the default wireless router we received from AT&T with our Fiber internet and the connection was very spotty.  The app shows the data transfer rate in the lower right-hand corner of the video feed and it would jump between 0KB/s and about 80KB/s.  All three were in different parts of the house, and varying distances from the wifi router, and each had the same difficulty.  I upgraded my wifi to a whole-home mesh system (which I planned to do regardless of the issues with the cameras) and the connectivity improved somewhat, but was still not consistent, even with one of the cameras sitting less than a foot from one of the wifi points.  I've tested other similar cameras (Wyze, Nest) in the same places as I have these and had absolutely no issues with them.  I also have a number of connected devices (Google Home, video doorbell, Chromecast, etc.) and have absolutely no issues with those.I contacted customer support and they responded quickly, within a day.  I explained the issues and after some back and forth, was told to connect them to a different network, because my network was not compatible with the cameras.  I asked what type of network was compatible with them and was given a list of network settings.  I double checked my network settings and they all matched the list I was given.  The customer service rep, Taylor, was dismissive, stating that there isn't a problem with the product.  If all 3 cameras are experiencing the same issue, it must be my network.  Well, if all 3 of these cameras are experiencing the same problem, and other products do not, maybe it is a problem with the product.  Maybe the product is junk.  So, I submitted a support ticket to return the cameras since they are not compatible with my network.  It's been a week and I haven't heard anything.Regarding the baby crying detection feature, it's pretty terrible.  It would send us an alert only when our kids were laughing, never if they were crying.  The app is decent, although I've found settings will randomly change, and not because of an update.  They just seem to have a mind of their own and will change on a whim.  For instance, you can choose whether you want your view to be in HD, SD, or Auto.  These settings seem to be different, regardless of which setting I've chosen, each time I open the app.Whether or not I'm able to return these, I'll be switching to the Wyze cameras.  They're less than half the cost, the app is WAY better and they have far more features.  They also give you free cloud storage.  Don't waste your money on a mediocre product from a terrible company."

To cool.One downside about the new camera is that there is no ""Motion AREA"" adjustment in the software. I called them and they said there is a fix for that due out in a week. I use mine outside (under a glass fishbowl to weatherproof it) and the tree  leaf motion sets it off so either I can set it for no recording or constant recording so the ""Motion Area"" adjustment is very important to me."

I bought two previously about 2 months back and was impressed enough to purchase a third one.As with the others, the user interface is very good, connectivity is solid and despite some false alerts here and there, it capture motion fairly well.I did purchase a new TP Link router before I installed the cameras and so far I haven't had any connection problems. I can almost always pull up my camera feed immediately and even if it has to buffer before loading, it's only a few seconds.Range is impressive with the cameras as well. I have two probably about 20 feet from our router but the third one is probably about 50 feet away, outside of our house and inside our shed. Connectivity is perfect so far despite the distance.The only real drawback I've found is night vision is not perfect. You definitely need the camera free of glare with a decent amount of ambient light in its field of view to work well in the dark. Day time footage is quite clear, but it may take some trial and error to get low light footage to be acceptable.Ultimately, it's an impressive feature set for the price. Its performance in the dark isn't stellar, and you'll get a few false alarms here and there but coupled with a good connection and an SD card is a capable little camera for the money."

Mainly, I want to be alerted when maintenance or building management enters my apartment for maintenance requests. Additionally, as I have a cat and I sometimes am gone for a night - I wanted to be able to monitor his activity and ensure he's fairing well.1. Very easy to set up. It connected without any trouble to my WiFi and was very user-friendly. The app is a breeze.2. I purchased the micro chip SD card separately so clips are saved beyond the 24 feed (until the card is full and then it will begin to record over itself).3. It's very lightweight, so though it is meant to be sat atop a table or shelf, I used the Command Velcro Strips and wall-mounted it for a birds eye view of my apartment. Works like a charm.4. I like the intercom feature. I am able to talk through it - whether it be to someone inside the apartment or the cat (hey, he gets lonely) and the microphone in the camera can pick up replies as well.5. My favorite part is that you can choose when you receive alerts. Obviously, when I'm home on the weekend, I don't want an alert every time I pass in front of the camera so I set it to weekdays only. From there, you can even choose the hours during which you get alerts. So if you work 9am-5pm, you just set it up for those hours and a nifty alert with a 6 second clip of what triggered the alert is available via the app.Great camera for easy indoor use. I would definitely recommend as the quality of the image and sound can't be beat at this price point."

 I purchased 2 of these cameras to keep an eye on my dog when I'm not home. I put one in his room and one over his bed so I can get a better view of him.Installation was easy. I purchased these sticky mount things on Amazon so that I can stick them to different places where the camera wouldn't be standing up. (The cameras come with little stands and screws to mount but if you dont want to make holes or want to put it somewhere you can't have it standing up then I suggest getting those little sticky adhesive Velcro mount thinds)The picture is decent. You download an app to your phone and it will give you alerts. You can set to however sensitive you want the alerts. I put the one over my dogs bed on high sensitivity so I can see when he wakes up. The one for his room I have a lower sensitivity because he always walks around the round doing his exercise and playing. You can purchase a micro sim card to use so you can store video until you can view it as space permits. If not you need to subscribe and pay to the companies cloud service."

The set up was very easy.  Took me less than 10 minutes.  The app told me exactly what to do and when I turned the camera on it started talking to me and told me exactly what to do!! :)  Compared to the first camera I purchased, which  took me three tries and even then I couldn't get it to connect when I wasn't home.2. This one works when you are away from home, you either use your phones data or you connect to secure wifi.3. After I figured out the activity screen it is awesome, just zoom in on the area you want it to watch so you aren't picking up cars driving by on a distant road.4.  The notification is very quick, so if you want to see what is going on you can sign on and probably catch the person/animal still in the act.5.  You can change the sensitivity too, that way you aren't picking up flies.  After I changed it to low I was able to still pick up a squirrel, cat and my children.CONS1.  It only does a short 6 second video, wish I could get a bit longer, but it works to notify me if someone is driving in my driveway when I'm not there.2. I am not sure how long it sits before it picks up more activity but right now I believe it is about 4 - 6 minutes.  Not bad, but it would be nice to have the option to increase the video length.  Maybe there is but I haven't asked yet.3.  I need to figure out how to get the activity frame to stay and not reset at night.  It keeps moving, so I reset it in the morning.  But for $30 some dollars, that is minor.All in all, this camera is awesome and does the job I need it to do.  When my kids are getting off the bus I can watch and make sure they safely get in the house.  I am thinking of adding more camera's to the house."
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: YI Home Security Camera, 1080p 2.4G WiFi IP Indoor Surveillance Camera with Night Vision, Motion Detection, Phone App, Pet Cat Dog Cam Works with Alexa and Google Assistance","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2017","Incredible, Elegant Home Security Solution",5.0,"Ok, so you're going to want to read this in its entirety as it contains information I wanted to know but couldn't find in any of the reviews or manufacturer comments.First off, WOW! This is going to sound like a shill review, but I assure you: I am a real person with no ties whatsoever to this company. I am a composer for film and TV shows with a home studio that is...well, it's expensive. While everything is insured and I keep redundant offsite backups of my files, it would still spell potential disaster for my career if my gear was stolen; when you're working with 12 hour deadlines for international clients you don't really get to say, ""er, my studio was stolen and it'll be two weeks before I can replace it,"" because that's when they say, ""cool, well we're going to find another composer."" To replace and rebuild a studio takes a lot of time.Because of this, I get extremely paranoid every time I go out of town. I just went on my honeymoon last week and purchased this camera to try to provide a bit of piece of mind, and it did that and more. Read on.This camera does one thing, and it does it efficiently and in a way that I can't conceive of being more user friendly than it is: it monitors your home and alerts you to any and all kinds of activity that involve changes in the space-time continuum. Considering that thieves and fires both exist within space-time, this camera has you covered.Not only does it alert you to any potential baddies looking to sack your castle, but it captures more than enough visual evidence to get a conviction. When it detects any motion, it immediately starts recording in crisp 1080p quality, and it doesn't need a whole lot of light to capture clear images.Quick rabbit trail: I see people complaining that it ""only"" records 6 seconds of video (which does include audio). Boo hoo. This is not a surveillance camera; it is a monitoring system, and it's a damn good one.Traditional home security systems can be problematic; for every 100 false alarms there might be one legitimate alert, but by then your local PD probably won't take it too seriously. It's also an issue when you have guests, and constantly needing to remember to punch in codes and the like just isn't my style. Having your dog shot or your door broken down by the police because a mouse tripped a motion sensor while you were vacationing in Bermuda is no bueno. This puts your home security in YOUR hands.So let's cover some important details:-Just to recap, this camera sends an alert to your device (it's compatible with all major mobile device iOS's) and records 6 seconds of beautiful, high quality video and audio when it detects any motion. You can choose to discard or save the video. Choosing the latter option saves it to the drive on your mobile device.-You can at your leisure ""check"" your camera, which allows you to monitor your home in real time. It doesn't record anything when you do this; it is simply live streaming what is happening in your home at that moment.-It must be plugged in at all times, which is actually preferable; batteries introduce one more point of potential failure in a device that, above all else, needs to be reliable.-It must have access to wifi at all times (kind of a no brainer, but I figured I should mention it).-IMPORTANT (and very cool): multiple people can log into your account at the same time. This means that if you're going on vacay somewhere where cell reception might be spotty, you can get two or three of your closest mates to download the app, give them your login info, and ask them to enable alerts from the app. They would then be alerted just as you are when any activity is detected and will have access to the video.So yeah, in my not so humble opinion this camera is a huge win for anyone looking to work on their home security game. Buy it with confidence. It is an unusually fantastic product."

It can be set to SD or HD, so you can extend your recording time, or reduce the cell bandwidth if watching from your phone.One thing that I particularly like is that the software (on Android, anyway) is fairly robust. You can set a trigger zone, sensitivity, and more. That is the main reason I tried this over another Sotion camera ... the software is clunky and you can't set trigger zones. So my ceiling fan would randomly trigger it. Also, it is easy to delete recorded clips that you don't need. At first I thought it only supported 6 second clips, but it sends you a 6 second review, with the option to watch the whole thing. I bought a micro SD card at the same time, and I'm pretty sure you need it for recording, but I wouldn't know because I started with it plugged in and ready to go.It uses QR codes for setup, which is quick and easy. I think that means that you HAVE to use a smartphone to set it up. There may be a way to do it by computer, but once again I set it up via my LG G5 and it was a breeze. One thing, during the setup, wait until you are ready to connect to the camera before you power it up. Otherwise the ""READY TO CONNECT!"" voice cue over and over will really get on your nerves.The audio chat is a nice feature, the sound quality is fair. Better than others I've tried.Once finances permit, I will be picking up a couple more of these. For the price point, I'd say this is a winner."

I repeat, you do NOT need an SD card.The SD card is only if you want it to record 24 hours a day so you can review later.If you do NOT install an SD card it works fine. What happens without an SD card is after you ""arm"" it when it senses movement, it sends an alert to your phone along with a 6 second video of what moved. Then it waits 3 minutes. If it still senses movement it sends you another alert and another 6 second video to your phone, etc. For me, this is all I need. If there is no movement, nothing gets recorded since there is no SD card. Without the SD card it is not recording 24 hours a day, it only records when it's ""armed"" and it senses movement.Now for the SD card. If you DO install an SD card it records everything to the SD card 24 hours a day, whether you want it to or not, and whether there is movement or not. The SD card has nothing to do with the alert or 6 second video sent to your phone. You get the alerts whether you have an SD card installed or not. I guess if you wanted to see what your dog did while you were gone, having the SD card would be useful. But I don't need to review what happened in my house for the past 24 hours and I don't need it recording me when I'm home to the SD card all the time, so I don't use an SD card. All I want is the alerts if someone breaks in. So basically you need an SD card ONLY if you want your rooms recorded 24 hours a day or you need to see everything that happened while you were gone. I hope this clears things up a little.The phone app is very well done. I like the fact that you can ""arm"" the camera to send alerts by pressing only one button labelled ""Away"". Then you disarm it when you get home by pressing one button on the app labelled ""Home"". So easy! And the setup of the camera was easier than I thought it would be.I liked the camera and the phone app so much I bought another one for the other room and going to buy their ""outdoor"" model for my backyard.

Heck, I own 5 of them. But I recently bought a 1080p camera (it was about the same price anyway). Initially, I wanted to try it as a baby cam. But it was late at night and I decided to test it and I replaced it with the one that I had facing out my front door window. it fit in the same base, so switching the cameras was very easy.If the camera is facing out a window, the night vision IR should be turned off or you will see a reflection. That's what I did with both of the cameras. But what I didn't expect was how much better the new camera would be at night! I certainly didn't expect a color image at nighttime. The detail is so much better! The sound is also improved - especially when speaking remotely to the camera (an area that the old camera lacked in). It's a nice feature even if I rarely use it.I didn't get a chance to try the new ""baby crying detection"" feature, but so far I love everything else about the camera.Yes, I've read the concerns about the privacy issues. So, for me, I just don't place them in places that might be concerning (over my bed, in the living room, etc). So if someone wants to watch my front door, back door, or my backyard chicken coop... enjoy (that must be a very boring life!).

So, this device is so easy to use and affordable enough that it's fine that I only use it for a single, weekly, purpose. I only bought one because I only need to know if they are there or not; if they've cleaned or not; and, if I can return home or if I need to work outside of my apartment for longer. It's perfect and it's always working whenever I ""pop in"" to look and see if and when my cleaning team is there."

So easy to set up a cave man could do it. Now that YI has cloud storage it makes huge sense as a security system. The camera still has a micro SD slot for a card so that recordings can stay local, but it is nice to have the cloud option (especially if the camera is stolen in a burglary). For the 60 bucks I paid for it I get an HD camera that I can readily identify anyone coming into my house. But more than that I get an alert to my smartphone and can view anyone setting off the alert and communicate with them from my office 10 miles away by two way audio. Will be setting up other YI cameras this week and see how they operate as a system. Love this and I can do my own monitoring. Also my wife and daughter can look on their smart phones before entering the house or property to make sure no unintended guests are lurking about.One note, if you keep your cameras on all the time and you are like me and walk around the house in various states of dress, you can be observed by whomever has access to your cameras (they are password protected so you have to invite someone to join your system). I have developed the habit of turning the cameras off when it is just me and my wife at home, and also setting the alert system to off so that when we are home and the cameras are on that I don't get an alert every 3 minutes. Great system for small to medium needs."

They are stationed inside, on windows, looking outside. Very easy to set up, very easy to use the app to see both cameras. The motion detection is working very well, the night vision works, although I did have a glare when I turned the IR light setting on, unfortunately, so I cannot utilize that function looking out the window, but I'm sure if they were looking inside the house, that function would work well. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and would happily recommend. Am considering buying 2 more for a couple blind spots."

I set motion detection setting, and it works very well during the daytime = no false alert. I put the sensitivity level as ""low"" for motion detection, but it still picks up a little bird hanging out in my yard. At night time, it picks up the cars passing by because apparently its headlight shines my front  yard??? --this I have never noticed before. Basically, I do get lots of false ""alerts"" at night but not during the daytime. I am not sure whether this has something to do with setting. Maybe I will have a heck of time in the winter when the Sun goes down early. All in all, I like it very much.

Of course, you can view the videos from your phone or tablet from anywhere where there is WiFi or cellular data.  Be sure to get the SD card to enable saving of the recorded video - don’t forget.

In the 6 years we had the camera running we’ve recorded multiple small crimes in our neighborhood which have benefitted our neighbors.  Included are attempted auto theft, recovery of stolen wallets, home vandalism and other resolution of small mysteries.  These cameras enable affordable convenient security for your home.

It's literally like a nightmare. I install extra security for the doors anywhere we move now. When I got this camera it took 5 minutes to set up. I was very nervous I'd have issues with it, but none at all. It sends notifications to my phone anytime movement is made. I now know my son's sleep pattern better than I ever have before. I even discovered him sitting in bed watching TV one night at 4AM! I was able to see this from my own bed and go in and get him back to sleep. It works perfectly away from home also, and the 2-way 'walkie talkie' also works very good. Point is this is a really great camera, it works as it should, good quality, the price point is great and it's helped me a ton already.

I decided to buy a camera because the Mailman said, ""it could have been your neighbor, but how can you prove it?"" I took the liberty of looking around and the NEST, Ring, and Arlo brands are so expensive! I took a chance with this little guy and to my tremendous surprise, it surpassed my expectations. Given, my expectations were really low, but this little guy stands perfectly still on my side window, keeping a watchful eye. At first, i was heavily bombarded by notifications, but it was because i placed it with view to a open road where every car was a motion to it. The system allows you to select the area where you want the camera to focus the attention. How cool is that?!? Now, i get a much lower notifications but still keeps me on my toes. I combine this with my echo dot to scare my wife every now and then. Just in case, Echo dot and the Yi Camera have no relation whatsoever, i like dropping in the Echo dot and then use the intercom feature of the camera to say dirty things to my wife.

I discovered that not only do the video files lack a date/timestamp but the date/time on the files themselves in explorer show an incorrect time of when they were created. The ONLY way to see a correct timeline is by logging into the app which means I would have to give the police my login information so they can stream the footage online (which would not only be extremely tedious for them, but I would be giving them full access to everything I've ever recorded including current live video/audio feed from my house). I emailed Yi support and got a response several days later (as they have no number to call) and they offered NO HELP. their response was that ""there MAY be a bug that would be possibly corrected in a later firmware update"".

Doesn’t bother me one bit as idc what others are saying just if they’re messing with my apartment door At night or unwanted strangers staggering into the building at all hours of the night (has happened in the past). This gives me peace of mind! Thankfully I have a great landlord who doesn’t mind the camera! Anyway, this is great and gets the job done. Would definitely buy again if I have issues with this one in the future."

I prefer the YI Home 1080p because the app allows you to turn off the IR illumination. This helps tremendously if you plan to use this to view through a window at night. I do miss the human detection offered on the YI Home 2 but I would rather have the ability to see through glass at night. Both cameras offer a clear picture.  Sometimes the app can be a bit slow when seeking through stored footage but that could be due to crowding on my WiFi network.I like that Yi offers some cloud storage for free. Most companies require a subscription for any cloud recording.I plan to buy an additional Yi camera or two over the next few months. They are the best value in WiFi security cameras.

I went camping and loved how I could just log on the app and see the view. I only put a couple stars for night vision because I have the cam in a window facing out and the camera’s little light was just reflecting in the window and I could not see out at night. I’m sure it’s great in a better spot. The quality of the picture is actually really good.

The picture quality is great.  The sound isn't the greatest but it does the job.  I only wish that instead of a ""crying"" alert that I could be notified if my dogs bark (I tried to use the crying alert but it doesn't seem to pick up the barking quite the same).  I also like the move alert notifications to see if the dogs go towards the door which usually indicates someone is in the hallway and that barking may ensue.  The feature that allows you to talk through the camera is great as well.Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase and recommend the camera!"

You can buy a micro sd card and the videos are stored on locally on the memory card.  The Yi Home app is easy to use and has a lot of features.  The camera rarely missed any motion and is very high quality.  I'm really impressed overall and am glad I didn't spend a lot of money on a monthly subscription for something like the nest cameras.  I ended up buying several more of these for around the house.I also use these inside of windows looking out and the video is very good.  The only time it's a little hard to see is when the sun is hitting it directly or it's really dark outside.  Obviously you have to turn off night vision when looking through a window but I'm very happy with the quality as an alternative to putting up expensive outdoor cameras.

I check in on my almost 4 year old during his quiet time, I can even talk to him over the app on my phone if needed or go back to see things he was doing earlier. The range of the camera can reach almost his whole room. The best part is that my husband works overnights for his job and he can also check his app from work and say goodnight. The sound quality is impressive. It can pick up my daughter crying in the next room from the camera in his room. I like that there is a pin in order to access each camera even after we are logged into the app. We didn't get the cloud plan but instead got the SD card. We plan on getting more of these cameras for the front and back doors as well. It gives peace of mind. The picture can get a little, only a little, fuzzy at times but I always know what's going on.

GREAT VALUE.",5.0,"Great design, easy-to-use product!  To be honest, it took me a bit of time (like an hour or so - tried manually updating the firmware, formatting the SD card, etc etc - all uneccessary - real problem was 2.4ghz wireless signal that is needed) to set up the initial camera. Once I figured out that the camera needed a 2.4ghz signal from the router and that was the issue, it was very smooth. Image / audio quality are fantastic, and serve our purposes well. My father has been ill, so we have a quite a few people in the house managing care. In order to monitor care and ensure our home is safe, I decided to buy one to test it out vs. a dropcam or nest given the really low price. Once I got the hang of it over a week or so, I bought another for another part of the house. Finally, just today, I bought 2 more of these cameras for other areas of the house. Super simple and high quality!! Highly recommend given the price and quality and easy of use!Note: I bought a 64gb Sandick microSD card for each camera to hold images and videos. The camera needs to be plugged into a normal outlet (110v). I have not tried to mount it yet (they are just sitting in various parts of the house), but will update when I do (if possible?)."
